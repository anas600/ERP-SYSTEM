## Sprint 5 — Demo V2 (The "Wow" Version) — Backend Phase 4 + 5 (2026-07-29) 🚧 IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Polished demo V2 with dashboard charts + global search.

### Added — Dashboard chart data (Phase 4 — T1/T2/T3)
- `GET /api/dashboard/charts/revenue?months=6` — revenue vs expense per month (line chart). Filters: `company_id`, status IN (Posted/Partial/Paid), expense from accounts.type=5 with status=2 journal entries.
- `GET /api/dashboard/charts/expenses-by-category?months=3` — pie / donut chart. One slice per Expense-type account with a fixed palette color by rank.
- `GET /api/dashboard/charts/top-customers?limit=5` — top customers by posted invoice total, all-time within the current company.
- New service: `Modules/Dashboard/Application/Services/DashboardChartService.cs`
- New DTOs: `Modules/Dashboard/Application/DTOs/ChartDtos.cs`
- New tests: `Tests/ERPSystem.Tests/Dashboard/DashboardChartTests.cs` (7 tests, 1 skipped integration)

### Added — Global search (Phase 5 — T4)
- `GET /api/search?q=&limit=20` — case-insensitive LIKE across customers, vendors, sales_invoices, and accounts. 3-tier ranking (exact > prefix > contains, scores 1.0/0.7/0.4). Per-type cap 5, total cap 20 (max 50). Always company-scoped.
- New module: `Modules/Search/` (Endpoints, Application/Services, Application/DTOs, AGENTS.md)
- New service: `Modules/Search/Application/Services/GlobalSearchService.cs`
- New DTOs: `Modules/Search/Application/DTOs/SearchDtos.cs`
- New tests: `Tests/ERPSystem.Tests/Search/GlobalSearchServiceTests.cs` (4 tests, 1 skipped integration)

### Changed
- `Host/Program.cs` — registered `IDashboardChartService` and `IGlobalSearchService` in DI.
- `Modules/Dashboard/Endpoints/GetSummary.cs` — added 3 chart endpoint methods to the existing `DashboardController` (route `/api/dashboard`).

### Notes
- All 4 new endpoints filter on `company_id` (Constitution Article 3, no `tenant_id`).
- Dapper only, no EF Core.
- `[Authorize(Policy = ReadAccess)]` on every new endpoint.
- 1 test per endpoint (per Article 11), 11 new tests total (2 skipped integration).
- The 2 failing `RetentionTests` are pre-existing — verified by `git stash` on bare develop (auth failure to `erp_test_system` test DB, not present in local Docker). Not a regression.

## Local Docker Demo — Setup (2026-07-29) ✅ MERGED

**Goal:** Self-contained local Docker stack for client demo on Anas's machine.

### ⏸️ PROJECT PAUSED (2026-07-29 18:25 UTC — 2 days)
**Per Anas's directive** to speed up work and coordination in a single environment:
- **Active (temporary permanent) constitution:** `.github/workflows/mavis-coordination/constitution.md` (was just created by سيتی + محمد)
- **Paused constitution:** `CONSTITUTION.md` (marked PAUSED, restored 2026-07-31 18:25 UTC)
- **Admin Team = سيتی + محمد + ديف** (Cloud) work as "Cron Jobs" coordinated by Mavis Local via `state.json`
- **Mavis Local = sole Tech Lead + Coordinator** for the 2-day window
- **No Telegram ping-pong** — all async via state.json
- **State.json is the single ping-pong point** — read it to know where the ball is
- **Pause until:** 2026-07-31 18:25 UTC
- **Reference:** [Anas's directive in this conversation](state.json)

### PR #172 — Local dev speed boost (in progress, NOT a code PR — gitignored config)
**Per Anas (2026-07-29):** Use local DB engine for faster dev. Switched `appsettings.Development.json` (gitignored) from Supabase to `localhost:5432` (local Docker Postgres).

**Impact:**
- Login: 30-60s (Supabase pooler) → **<1s (local)**
- DB queries: ~100ms → <5ms
- Works offline (no internet needed)
- Schema/data identical to cloud (same migrations + seed)

**Constraint noted:** The sprint-5 hand-off said "PostgreSQL 17 (Supabase for dev, Docker for local) | No new DB engine". This change is consistent — still PostgreSQL, just local instead of cloud. Engine unchanged. Hand-off constraint remains for non-Mavis-Local devs.

### PR #170 — Local Docker config fix (MERGED at `c57a25d`)
- Fixed 5 docker-compose.yml bugs that blocked any local Docker usage:
  1. Frontend volume mount: `./src/frontend` → `../src/frontend`
  2. API build context: `.` → `../src/backend`
  3. Added `ConnectionStrings__Migrations` + `Marten__ConnectionString` env vars
  4. Added `Database__JsonMigrationEnabled: "true"`
  5. Documented wget-not-in-image issue (deferred to PR #171)
- Added: `docs/workflow/local-docker-fixes-report.md` (full technical report)

### PR #171 — Local Docker P1 fixes + architecture (in progress)
**Branch:** `fix/local-docker-p1-architecture` (off `c57a25d`)

#### Fixed
- **P1 seed issues:**
  - **Issue A (cancelled):** `users` schema was already correct (no `is_email_verified`)
  - **Issue B:** Added `SECTION 7.5: Roles` before `SECTION 8: user_roles` (4 canonical roles: Admin, Accountant, ProjectManager, Viewer)
  - **Issue C:** Activity log now uses `array_agg(id) FROM users WHERE is_active` — no more hardcoded UUID collision with ALF-CONST company
  - **Issue D:** Admin user inserted explicitly with system UUID `00000000-...-0002` + user_companies (4 companies) + user_roles (Admin)
- **P2 docker:** Removed `wget` healthcheck (not in ASP.NET image)

#### Added (architecture improvements)
- `docs/workflow/local-docker.md` — Architecture doc (when to use, how it works)
- Improved `local-docker/README.md` (curl healthcheck, troubleshooting)
- Updated `AGENTS.md` (cross-link to local-docker)

#### Changed
- `v_admin_id` in seed now uses `00000000-...-0002` (was wrongly pointing to `11111111-...` = ALF-CONST company)
- Activity log loop uses dynamic `array_length(v_user_ids, 1)` (no magic number 10)

#### Verified
- `docker compose up -d --build` → all 3 containers running
- `psql -f docs/seed-sprint4-demo-data.sql` → no manual workarounds needed
- `POST /api/auth/login admin@alfajr.local / Demo1234` → 200 + JWT
- All 10 users can log in
- Browser: http://localhost:3000 → working

## Sprint 4 (in progress) — Polish + Demo Data (2026-07-29)

### Added
- `docs/architecture/holding-company-architecture.md` — Full architecture documentation
- `docs/seed-sprint4-demo-data.sql` — Demo data seed (3 companies, 10 users, 100+ transactions)
- `src/backend/Tests/ERPSystem.Tests/Seed/Sprint4SeedTests.cs` — 19 static tests (no DB) for the seed file
- `docs/workflow/sprint-4.md` — Sprint 4 hand-off documentation
- Child DOX entry: `src/backend/Tests/ERPSystem.Tests/Seed/` added to `Tests/AGENTS.md` index

### Changed
- **CLEANUP AMENDMENT 2026-07-29 (per Anas):**
  - 9 stale feature branches deleted (`feature/dec-088-*`, `feature/local-docker-setup*`, `feature/phase5b-*`, `feature/phase-5-ar`, `feature/sprint-2-companies-users`, `governance/setup-cycle-1`, `hotfix/v1.0.34-data-and-reports`)
  - 124 documentation files removed (old DECs, hand-offs, E2E reports, phase plans, seed SQLs, governance dumps)
  - CONSTITUTION.md restructured: 10 articles → 15 articles (added Articles 9-15: cleanup, local team, tests, presence, Mephisto, amendment, communication)
  - AGENTS.md simplified (root + docs/)
  - 4 branches remain: `main`, `develop`, `feature/abdo-team`, `feature/sprint-4-polish-demo-data`

### Fixed
- Hallucination reset: removed all `tenant_id`/`TenantContext` references (0 found in repo)
- Branch clutter: 13 → 4 branches
